## Current Research
**Study of Symmetry-Resolved Entanglement in CFT and Holography**
  - Extracted information from symmetry-resolved entanglement (RÂ´enyi) entropy at large charge limit
  - Explored more entanglement quantities in symmetry resolution
  - Tried to understand symmetry-resolved quantities using holography
