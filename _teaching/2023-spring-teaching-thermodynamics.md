I was a teaching assistant in the course of Thermoynamics. The lecturer was [Prof. Yuanbo Zhang](https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/f7/62/c7605a63330/page.htm) (张远波).

I Evaluated assignments and conducted bi-weekly tutorial sessions. I also wrote lecture notes (in Chinese) for every tutorial session. Here are some of them:

[Fourth](/files/thermodynamics/tutorial4.pdf), [fifth](/files/thermodynamics/tutorial5.pdf), and [seventh](/files/thermodynamics/tutorial7.pdf) lectures for tutorial sessions.
